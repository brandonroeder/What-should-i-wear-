What-should-i-wear-
===================

Simple weather app to help you decide what to wear

Version 0.0.1

Written in Python using wxPython (http://wxpython.org/) and the Wunderground API (http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/)

I also used pyzipcode, a cool little package to lookup information about zipcodes (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyzipcode/)

To do:

Currently the app is pretty crudly put together as I really just wanted to play around with the Wunderground API.

I would like to:

	Implement the whole thing using fixers (which I should have done in the first place)
	Improve UI
	Add more detailed forecast data (3 day, 5 day, etc)
